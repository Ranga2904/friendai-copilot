    "Take a breath. You've got this. They reached out because they want to connect with you. There's no wrong answer here. Just respond as yourself - that's enough.",
    "It's okay to feel nervous. But remember: this person is hoping for a response, not judging every word. Whatever you send will be appreciated.",
    "Pause. Breathe. You don't have to be perfect. A simple, honest reply is better than an anxious, overworked one. You're allowed to just... respond.",
    "This is just a message. Not a test. Not a performance. They'll be happy to hear from you no matter what you say.",
    "Your anxiety is lying to you. There is no 'wrong' way to reply to someone who genuinely wants to talk to you. Just be you.",
    "Breathe in for 4, hold for 4, out for 4. Good. Now remember: they texted YOU. That means they like talking to you. You're already doing great.",
    "It's just words on a screen. You can take your time. You can edit. You can delete and restart. There's no pressure here except what you're putting on yourself.",
    "Whatever you're imagining will go wrong? It probably won't. And even if it's not perfect, that's okay. Imperfect is human. Human is good.",
    "You're not being judged. You're not being tested. This is just a person who wants to connect. Respond as simply as feels right.",
    "Breathe. Ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor. Now remember: every message you've sent before worked out. This one will too."
